Let your friends know if you are around!

Development Status: **Very unstable.**

## Run

* Clone from Github
* `npm install`
* `npm run rebuild`
* `npm start`
* Profit!


## TODO

* Make feeds download only
* Store last status/name of friends in DB. Use <- to show feed offline = friend offline
* Change status to offline on exit
* Nicer UI (thinking two tab panes, one for friends and one user)
* Add dates to status and show last update time
